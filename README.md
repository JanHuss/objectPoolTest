# ObjectPoolTest
Test application to create an Object Pool pattern that could be used for the Voice pools.

This code is taken from Sourcemaking.com ([Object Pool](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/object_pool)).
The code has been refactored to work within multiple classes and is setup to how I intend to make use of it within the engine.
